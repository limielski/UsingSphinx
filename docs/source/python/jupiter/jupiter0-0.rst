Maybe you’ve already worked with Jupyter Notebooks from Project Jupyter to create documents containing runnable code. You can achieve even more with JupyterLab, a tool kit that you can use to document and share your research, teaching, and learning activities. It’s useful in a wide range of disciplines, from data analysis and data visualization to scientific study.

JupyterLab enhances your notebooks by providing a browser-based interface that allows you to use multiple notebooks together effectively. In addition, it offers you a comprehensive Markdown editor, file manager, file viewer, and an infrastructure that enables you to run code from a wide range of files.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:

* Share code between multiple Jupyter Notebooks
* Debug a Jupyter Notebook
* Create and manage Markdown files
* Run embedded code from a range of different files
* Manage and view different file types from a single interface
* Access your operating system from within JupyterLab

Jupyter is a portmanteau word blended from the three programming languages Julia, Python, and R. Although you’ll focus on Python in this tutorial, you can use Jupyter with the other languages as well. Plus, this free application works on macOS, Linux, and Windows environments.

JupyterLab takes Jupyter Notebook usage to a different level, so you’ll get the most out of this tutorial if you’re already familiar with Jupyter Notebook.
