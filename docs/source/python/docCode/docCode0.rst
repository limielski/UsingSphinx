Documenting Python Projects With Sphinx and Read the Docs
=========================================================

Sphinx is a document generation tool thatâ€™s become the de facto standard for Python projects. It uses the reStructuredText (RST) markup language to define document structure and styling, and it can output in a wide variety of formats, including HTML, ePub, man pages, and much more. Sphinx is extendable and has plugins for incorporating pydoc comments from your code into your docs and for using MyST Markdown instead of RST.

Read the Docs is a free document hosting site where many Python projects host their documentation. It integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket to automatically pull new documentation sources from your repositories and build their Sphinx sources.
