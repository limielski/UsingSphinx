Python's doctest: Document and Test Your Code at Once
=====================================================

https://realpython.com/python-doctest/

Are you interested in writing usage examples for your code that work as documentation and test cases simultaneously? If your answer is yes, then Python’s doctest module is for you. This module provides a testing framework that doesn’t have too steep a learning curve. It’ll allow you to use code examples for two purposes: documenting and testing your code.

Apart from allowing you to use your code’s documentation for testing the code itself, doctest will help you keep your code and its documentation in perfect sync at any moment.

In this tutorial, you’ll:

* Write doctest tests in your code’s documentation and docstrings
* Understand how doctest works internally
* Explore the limitations and security implications of doctest
* Use doctest for test-driven development
* Run your doctest tests using different strategies and tools

You won’t have to install any third-party libraries or learn complex APIs to follow this tutorial. You only need to know the basics of Python programming and how to use the Python REPL or interactive shell.
