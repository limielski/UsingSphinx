Build Your Python Project Documentation With MkDocs
===================================================

https://realpython.com/python-project-documentation-with-mkdocs/

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to quickly build documentation for a Python package using MkDocs and mkdocstrings. These tools allow you to generate nice-looking and modern documentation from Markdown files and your code’s docstrings.

Maintaining auto-generated documentation means less effort because you’re linking information between your code and the documentation pages. However, good documentation is more than just the technical description pulled from your code! Your project will appeal more to users if you guide them through examples and connect the dots between the docstrings.

The Material for MkDocs theme makes your documentation look good without any extra effort and is used by popular projects such as Typer CLI and FastAPI.
