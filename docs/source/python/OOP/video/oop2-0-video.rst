============================================

https://realpython.com/courses/python-basics-class/

Ian Currie 9 Lessons  34m

In the previous course in the Python Basics series, you learned how to use classes to create new objects. Now that you understand the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP), it’s time to put those classes to work.

In this video course, you’ll learn how to:

* Compose classes together to create layers of functionality
* Inherit and override behavior from other classes to create variations
* Creatively mix and match these approaches

With these capabilities, you’ll be able to build more complex systems and write readable, reusable code.

This video course is part of the Python Basics series, which accompanies Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3.

Note that you’ll be using IDLE to interact with Python throughout this course. If you’re just getting started, then you might want to check out Python Basics: Setting Up Python before diving into this course.
