Python f-strings provide a quick way to interpolate and format strings. They’re readable, concise, and less prone to error than traditional string interpolation and formatting tools, such as the .format() method and the modulo operator (%). An f-string is also a bit faster than those tools!

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll know why f-strings are such a powerful tool that you should learn and master as a Python developer.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:

* Interpolate values, objects, and expressions into your strings using f-strings
* Format f-strings using Python’s string formatting mini-language
* Leverage some cool features of f-strings in Python 3.12 and beyond
* Decide when to use traditional interpolation tools instead of f-strings
* To get the most out of this tutorial, you should be familiar with Python’s string data type. It’s also be beneficial to have experience with other string interpolation tools like the modulo operator (%) and the .format() method.
