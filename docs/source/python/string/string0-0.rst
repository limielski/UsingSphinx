If you’re looking for ways to remove or replace all or part of a string in Python, then this course is for you. You’ll be taking a fictional chat room transcript and sanitizing it using both the .replace() method and the re.sub() function.

In Python, the .replace() method and the re.sub() function are often used to clean up text by removing strings or substrings or replacing them. In this tutorial, you’ll be playing the role of a developer for a company that provides technical support through a one-to-one text chat. You’re tasked with creating a script that’ll sanitize the chat, removing any personal data and replacing any swear words with emoji.
