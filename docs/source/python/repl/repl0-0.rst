Ptpython is a feature-rich and user-friendly Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that takes your interactive Python coding experience to a whole new level. Unlike the standard Python REPL, ptpython offers a host of powerful features designed to boost productivity and streamline the development process. Its intuitive interface, syntax highlighting, and robust auto-completion capabilities make writing and exploring Python code a breeze.

The interactive shell also provides the built-in ability to inspect Python objects, so you can quickly look up function references and module documentation without leaving the REPL environment. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced Python programmer, ptpython’s interactive shell and multiline editing support will help you produce quality code.
