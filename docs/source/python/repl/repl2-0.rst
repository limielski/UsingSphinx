When youâ€™re executing Python code, the standard Python shell that comes with your Python installation is a natural tool to use. However, as you progress in your coding journey, you might find yourself seeking more powerful functionalities than the standard REPL offers. Luckily, IPython offers an enhanced version of interactive Python that can supercharge your capabilities.

Using the IPython shell is a fast way of learning Python and executing code without the need for a full-fledged integrated development environment (IDE), such as PyCharm. IPython adds great features to the Python experience with its magic commands, which the standard Python shell lacks. These can help you complete tasks more quickly.
