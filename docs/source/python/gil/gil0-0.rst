Bypassing the GIL for Parallel Processing in Python
===================================================

Unlocking Python’s true potential in terms of speed through shared-memory parallelism has traditionally been limited and challenging to achieve. That’s because the global interpreter lock (GIL) doesn’t allow for thread-based parallel processing in Python. Fortunately, there are several work-arounds for this notorious limitation, which you’re about to explore now!
