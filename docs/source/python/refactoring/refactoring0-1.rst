Refactoring Python Applications for Simplicity
==============================================

https://realpython.com/python-refactoring/

Do you want simpler Python code? You always start a project with the best intentions, a clean codebase, and a nice structure. But over time, there are changes to your apps, and things can get a little messy.

If you can write and maintain clean, simple Python code, then it’ll save you lots of time in the long term. You can spend less time testing, finding bugs, and making changes when your code is well laid out and simple to follow.

In this tutorial you’ll learn:

How to measure the complexity of Python code and your applications
How to change your code without breaking it
What the common issues in Python code that cause extra complexity are and how you can fix them
Throughout this tutorial, I’m going to use the theme of subterranean railway networks to explain complexity because navigating a subway system in a large city can be complicated! Some are well designed, and others seem overly complex.
